## Intro

This solution was created in Visual Studio 2022.  

You should be able to use VS 2022 Community (free version) to complete the work.

Older versions of Visual Studio are not advised.

The projects in the solution are ordered by difficulty.

The intent behind these tasks is to provide you with different levels of difficulty where you can showcase your skills, experience, and style.

We will use your solutions to these problems as talking points in the technical interview.

We expect and trust you to do this work yourself.  

Questions are welcome and expected.

This will be due at the start of the technical interview.


## Assignments

### 1.DoThisFirst

- The Program.cs file contains a comments section that describe what we expect.
- This is a very easy exercise that should be something you can do in less than an hour.
- Obviously, do this one first.

### 2.DoThisNext
- Again, the Program.cs file contains a comments section that describe what we expect.
- This project is a little more challenging, but should be something you can do in a few hours.

### 3.BonusChallenge
- This has a readme file at the root of the project with further instructions and requirements.  
- This is a more difficult challenge - as such, it is optional.
- Feel free to submit a partially complete project - as long as we can debug, its fine.



## How to complete the homework

- Fork this into a repository name-candidate-homework on your GitHub account (where name is your name or github user)
- Do the assignments and commit/push to your public repository (make sure its public!)
- Send us the url to clone your repo

Ideally, we want this done at least 24 hours before the technical interview, so we can address any issues that come up.
