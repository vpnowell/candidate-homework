             *  Write code that meets the following requirements:
             *      - takes input of an arbitrary list of strings (examples provided in Resource.cs
             *      - for each string, looks at the other strings to search for anagrams (ignoring case)
             *      - returns a list of lists, where
             *          - each list contains the anagrams of the first string (not case sensitive)
             *          - list of lists is sorted alphabetically by the first item in each list
             *          - each list is also sorted alphabetically
             *          - the string occurs only once in any of the output lists
             *          - the list of lists contains all the strings in the input, but only once
             *          - does not contain duplicates or whitespace values
             *      - if the word does not have an anagram, it is still added as the only element  
             *      - does NOT use any NuGet packages or 3rd party libraries (only stuff that comes with .Net)
             *      - however, feel free to add methods or classes as you see fit
             *      
             *
             *
             *  example output:
             *
             *  given a list such as:  { "Kyoto", "London", "Portland", "Tokyo", "Wichita", "Donlon", "Anchorage" }
             *
             *  proper output should be:
             *
             *      Anchorage
             *      Donlon, London
             *      Kyoto, Tokyo
             *      Portland
             *      Wichita
             *
             *  improper output would be: 
             *      Kyoto, Tokyo
             *      London, Donlon
             *      Tokyo, Kyoto
             *      Wichita
             *      Donlon, London
             *      Anchorage
             *
             *  
             *  Example lists of anagrams are included in Resources.cs, but your code should work for ANY list of strings
             *
             *
             *
             *  Your code should be in the Output method below.
             *  
             *  You can do this challenge without using any 3rd party libraries - remember - we want to see YOUR work
