               Write code that meets the following requirements:
                   - loops through all integers from 1 to 100 and prints to the console according to the following rules
                       - where the integer is a multiple of 3, the console prints the word 'Fizz'
                       - where the integer is a multiple of 5, the console prints the word 'Buzz' 
                       - where the integer is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the console prints the words 'Fizz Buzz'
                       - otherwise the console simply prints the integer value
              
             
                   - example output:
             
                   1
                   2
                   Fizz
                   4
                   Buzz

               Please do this work yourself - you should be able to do this easily without any 3rd party libraries
